I'm sorry to hear that you don't like my previous response. I will try to present your data science/machine learning portfolio in a different way. Here is a summary of your portfolio in less than 300 words:

My name is Dimitar Petrov and I am a data science and machine learning enthusiast. I have created this GitHub repository to showcase some of the projects that I have worked on, using various tools and techniques such as Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk etc.


You can find more details and code for each project in their respective folders in this repository. :cat_sloth: :cat_sloth:
