# Healthcare-Analytics

This project is about using data to help hospitals improve patient care and reduce costs. I used Python to create three models that can predict how long a patient will stay in the hospital based on their admission details. This can help hospitals optimize their treatment plans, reduce the length of stay, and lower the infection rates.

## Contents of Repository

- **Python Notebook file**: Contains the project code for data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning models (Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- **Datasets.zip**: Contains both the test and train data used in the project.

Healthcare organizations are under increasing pressure to improve patient care outcomes and achieve better care. While this situation represents a challenge, it also offers organizations an opportunity to dramatically improve the quality of care by leveraging more value and insights from their data. Health care analytics refers to the analysis of data using quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore trends and patterns in the acquired data. While healthcare management uses various metrics for performance, a patient’s length of stay is an important one.

## Project Highlights

I analyzed hospital admission data to accurately predict the patient’s length of stay at the time of admit so that the hospitals can optimize resources and function better. I built three models in Python to predict the length of stay:

- A supervised algorithm Naïve Bayes which achieved an accuracy of 34.55%.
- An ensemble method XGBoost which achieved an accuracy of 43.05%.
- A dense neural network with 6 layers which achieved an accuracy of 42.5%.
